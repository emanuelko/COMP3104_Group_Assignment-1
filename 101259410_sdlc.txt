SDLC or the Software Development Life Cycle is a process that produces software with the highest
 quality and lowest cost in the shortest time possible. 
SDLC provides a well-structured flow of phases that help an organization to quickly
 produce high-quality software which is well-tested and ready for production use.

How the SDLC Works

 SDLC works by lowering the cost of software development while simultaneously 
 improving quality and shortening production time. SDLC achieves these apparently
  divergent goals by following a plan that removes the typical pitfalls of software development projects. 
 That plan starts by evaluating existing systems for deficiencies.
