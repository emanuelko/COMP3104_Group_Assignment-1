DevOps is a combination of cultural philosophies, methods, and tools that increase the ability of organizations 
to develop and improve products faster than organizations using traditional software development and
 infrastructure management processes, enabling them to deliver applications and services at high speed. 
This speed allows organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.
