DevOps, a component of development (Dev) and operations (Ops),
 is a collection of people, processes, and technologies that come together to deliver value to customers on an ongoing basis.

What does DevOps mean for teams? DevOps enables formerly disparate development, 
IT operations, quality engineering, and security roles to coordinate and collaborate 
to produce better and more reliable products. Teams that adopt a DevOps culture, along with DevOps methods and tools, 
are better able to respond to customer needs, increase their confidence in the applications they build, and achieve business goals more quickly.
