George Brown College provides a blend of theory and hands-on experience,
 which encouraged me to apply for this. 
 They prioritize real-world learning and provide students with opportunities to work alongside 
 industry professionals in applied research and field education opportunities

MY OPİNİON 
 
George Brown College offers its students many opportunities to develop themselves
only if these opportunities are used by students, they gain value. 
However, the professors motivate us students in this regard.

My Second Opinion

However, since I am a teacher and want to continue my life as a teacher in the future, 
I will have to teach this DEVOPS logic to my students. 
People can move forward only with this and similar logic
